## Unreleased

### Features:

- **AG-UI transport** (`AshA2ui.AgUi`) — surfaces are now consumable by
  AG-UI clients (CopilotKit chat UIs and anything else speaking the
  protocol) from any HTTP host, joining the AG-UI/A2UI interoperability
  stack. The module is framework-free (Jason only; compiled under
  `NO_PHOENIX`): AG-UI event builders (run lifecycle, streamed text, tool
  calls, custom), the `a2ui-surface` `ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT` binding carrying
  A2UI message lists under `a2ui_operations`, SSE frame encoding,
  `RunAgentInput` decoding, and `decode_action/1` converting AG-UI client
  actions into the spec-valid v0.9.1 envelopes
  `AshA2ui.ActionHandler`/`AshA2ui.Dynamic` consume. The new
  [External Transports](documentation/topics/external-transports.md) topic
  documents the endpoint contract, event mapping, the CopilotKit
  `selfManagedAgents` client wiring (no Node middleman), the
  authentication/actor contract, and the **designed** (deferred) A2A
  binding (`DataPart` + `application/a2ui+json`).
- **Per-resolve `spec_version:` override** —
  `AshA2ui.Info.build_surface/2`, `build_data_model/2`, and
  `AshA2ui.ActionHandler.handle/3` now accept `spec_version: "0.9.1" |
  "1.0"`, overriding the surface's declared version for that call.
  Transports pin the wire version to what their renderer actually speaks
  (CopilotKit's shipped A2UI renderer processes v0.9 messages only)
  without touching surface DSLs.

- **A2UI v1.0 (RC) support** — to our knowledge the first framework
  shipping a v1.0 conformance suite. `spec_version "1.0"` (DSL) /
  `spec_version: "1.0"` (`AshA2ui.Dynamic.resolve/2`) opts a surface into
  the v1.0 wire contract; v0.9.1 stays the default and its output is
  byte-identical. See the new [A2UI 1.0](documentation/topics/a2ui-1-0.md)
  topic for the full contract and UX rationale.
  - `AshA2ui.Encoder.V1_0`: single inline `createSurface` (components +
    initial data model in one message — no create-then-update flash, one
    payload for HTTP/agent-tool transports), `wantResponse: true` on every
    action event, v1.0 catalog/envelope, `surface_properties` option
    (v1.0's rename of `theme`; `primaryColor` is gone and was never our
    seam), automatic Markdown headings (the v1.0 basic catalog dropped the
    `h1`–`h5` Text variants; literal headings become `"## …"`, data-bound
    ones interpolate via `formatString`), wire `returnType`/`callableFrom`
    stripped from function calls, and `call_function/3` for judicious
    server→client RPC.
  - `AshA2ui.ActionHandler`: the v1.0 **actionResponse contract** — actions
    carrying an `actionId` are answered first with an `actionResponse`
    echoing the id (`{"value": …}` / `{"error": {code, message}}` with
    stable codes: `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `INVALID_ACTION`,
    `ACTION_FAILED`); the v0.9.1 status trio (`/ui/status`,
    `/ui/action_result`, `/ui/action_result_text`) collapses into one
    structured `/ui/response` object mirrored by the response.
  - The shipped JS hook is the v1.0-capable client layer (no published
    `@a2ui/lit`/`@a2ui/web_core` release ships a v1.0 runtime yet): it
    expands inline `createSurface` for the v0_9 renderer, generates the
    `actionId` handshake with **0-RTT optimistic pending state** on
    `/ui/response` plus a timeout watchdog, dispatches
    `"ash-a2ui:action-response"` DOM events, and executes `callFunction`
    against a host-registered function table (`openUrl` built in;
    responses return via the `"a2ui:function_response"` LiveView event).
  - The executable spec: vendored v1.0 schemas/catalog/conformance cases
    (pinned commit in `priv/a2ui/v1_0/NOTES.md`), the upstream schema
    suites running in `test/v1_0_conformance_test.exs` (draft-7-invisible
    `unevaluatedProperties` cases pinned explicitly), and encoder/handler
    conformance suites asserting the semantic rules schemas can't express
    (explicit `value` on every `updateDataModel` — v1.0 deletes on omitted
    value; UAX #31 identifier rules on all generated names; actionId echo).

- Agent-composed surfaces: `AshA2ui.Dynamic` resolves a runtime,
  JSON-serializable surface spec — a declarative mirror of the DSL
  vocabulary an LLM can emit as structured tool output, never raw A2UI —
  into a served surface with the same rigor as the compile-time DSL. Specs
  are gated by a host-configured resource allowlist
  (`AshA2ui.Dynamic.allowlist/1`, `extension_resources/1`), built through
  Spark's own entity schemas, field-inferred by the existing transformer,
  and validated by the *same* verifier modules the DSL compiles with (run
  at runtime over a synthetic DSL state — same checks, same messages).
  `spec_schema/1` ships a JSON Schema for LLM tool parameters,
  `describe_resources/1` a prompt-ready resource vocabulary, and validation
  failures return structured `AshA2ui.Dynamic.Error`s that reuse the
  verifier texts so an agent loop can self-correct. Serving is
  stateless-but-tamper-proof: hosts hold the resolved
  `AshA2ui.Dynamic.Surface` server-side and route envelopes through
  `handle_action/3` on the server-held struct — the row-action allowlist,
  query allowlists, `visible_when` enforcement, and actor-based
  `authorize?: true` authorization apply exactly as on declared surfaces.
  See the new `agent-composed-surfaces` topic and the `ash_a2ui:dynamic`
  usage rules.
- The spec-as-artifact lifecycle: agent-composed specs are now first-class,
  persistable, reviewable artifacts.
  - `AshA2ui.Dynamic.serialize/1` / `deserialize/2` — a canonical stored
    form (versioned `{"spec": ..., "spec_format": 1}` envelope, object keys
    sorted at every level, so identical specs serialize byte-identically)
    plus `fingerprint/1` (`"sha256:..."`) as the content identity. Loading
    **re-validates against the current resource state** through
    `resolve/2`: fields/actions/resources removed since a spec was saved
    surface as the same structured `AshA2ui.Dynamic.Error` list a fresh
    spec would produce — drift becomes reviewable errors, not a crash.
  - `AshA2ui.Dynamic.diff/2` — the change summary a ratifying human reads:
    computed at the spec vocabulary level (components, queries and their
    presets, fields, actions, contexts matched by name; option-level
    changes with old and new values; `row_layout` flattened to dotted
    options), never a raw JSON diff. `AshA2ui.Dynamic.Diff.summary/1`
    renders per-change review lines; changes are Jason-encodable for
    review UIs.
  - `AshA2ui.Dynamic.to_dsl_source/2` — promote a validated spec into the
    source of a checked-in `AshA2ui.Standalone` module: formatted with the
    DSL's own `locals_without_parens`, compile-ready, provenance-commented
    with the spec fingerprint. Resolving the promoted module is equivalent
    to resolving the spec directly (held as a round-trip property in the
    test suite).
- Section card chrome: context picker sections, `:detail` panels, and query
  controls now emit as a basic-catalog `Card` over a `_body` container
  (`context_<name>` > `context_<name>_body`, `detail_<name>` >
  `detail_<name>_body`, `query<sfx>_controls` > `query<sfx>_controls_body`)
  — the same shape as form groups and card-style table rows, so every
  renderer gets consistent section chrome via the `--a2ui-card-*` theme
  variables. Root children ids are unchanged.
- Typeahead comboboxes for search pickers: the merged catalog
  (`priv/js/ash_a2ui_catalog.js`) now also overrides `Column` (opt-in by
  passing `ColumnApi` in the deps). The override renders exactly like the
  basic Column unless the component is an AshA2ui picker composite —
  detected via the frozen id contract (`context_<name>_body`,
  `form_select_<field>`) plus structural verification of the live
  component tree. Searchable composites become a real combobox: debounced
  search-as-you-type dispatching the existing `context_search` /
  `option_search` wire actions, results in an anchored overlay with
  keyboard navigation (arrows/Enter/Escape), a "Type to search…" hint
  instead of the pre-search option dump, and the selection collapsed to a
  chip with Clear. Non-searchable context pickers render their option page
  as a chip group with the selection highlighted. The wire format is
  unchanged (plain basic catalog) — renderers without the merged catalog
  fall back to the flat composite. New theme knobs: `--a2ui-combobox-*`
  and `--a2ui-chip-*`.

- Surface contexts: the new `context` DSL entity declares a named,
  server-validated record selection over any Ash resource that scopes the
  rest of the surface. Picker contexts emit a searchable surface-level
  picker (state at `/context/<name>`, options at `/options/<name>`) driven
  by the new `"context_search"` / `"context_select"` / `"context_clear"`
  client actions — every selection round-trips through an **authorized
  read**. `depends_on` + `depends_on_path` make dependent option sources
  (a parent's selection filters the child's options; changes cascade —
  dependents clear, re-derive, and `auto_select_single` re-selects sole
  options). Tables scope to selections with `context_filter` (equality
  ANDed onto every read) and `require_context` (no selection → no read,
  empty table); `select_context` adds a per-row button selecting a
  (typically pickerless) context — the master half of master/detail. All
  compile-verified by the new `AshA2ui.Verifiers.VerifyContexts`;
  context-less surfaces are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- `:detail` components: render a context's selected record as a
  field-by-field card bound to `/detail/<context>` (fields default to the
  context resource's public attributes; calculations/aggregates load like
  table fields) — the detail half of master/detail.
- Client-driven range filters: the `query` entity gains `range_filters`
  (public attributes only). The `/query` state gains a per-field
  `"ranges"` map (`{"from": "", "to": ""}`, inclusive bounds cast to the
  attribute's type before any read; plain `YYYY-MM-DD` bounds on datetime
  fields expand to day start/end), and the encoder emits from/to
  TextFields at `/query/ranges/<field>/from|to`.
- The LiveView transport tracks the last pushed `/context` state and
  passes it to PubSub refreshes as `:context_state` (like `:query_state`),
  so live refreshes preserve the user's selections;
  `AshA2ui.Info.build_surface/2` / `build_data_model/2` accept
  `:context_state` for custom transports.
- Form field groups: the new `group` DSL entity inside `:form` components
  (`group :scheduling do label "Scheduling"; columns 2; fields [...] end`)
  renders a labeled section — a Card wrapping a heading Text (h3) over the
  group's fields laid out in rows of `columns` equal-weight Columns (the
  last row padded with empty spacers; single-column groups skip the grid
  wrappers). Inputs, bindings, and submit semantics are unchanged — groups
  only re-arrange containers. Ordering contract: ungrouped fields render in
  place and a group renders whole at the position of its first member in
  the form's field order. Compile-verified (group fields ⊆ form fields,
  unique group names, no field in two groups) by the new
  `AshA2ui.Verifiers.VerifyLayouts`; group-less forms emit byte-identical
  payloads.
- Card-style table rows: the new singleton `row_layout` entity inside
  `:table` components (`row_layout do title :name; badge :is_active;
  badge_text true: "Active"; meta [...]; columns 3 end`) turns the templated
  record row into a Card — a header Row of the title Text (h4, weight 1)
  and a right-hand Row of the badge Text plus the row's actions/select
  button, over an N-column grid of caption-labeled meta values (honoring
  field `format`). The badge binds the new computed `_badge_<field>` row
  key (the `badge_text` entry matching the value, else the humanized value)
  serialized identically on initial render and every handler refresh; the
  raw field value stays untouched. `title`/`badge`/`meta` references are
  compile-verified against the table's fields (each at most once);
  layout-less tables keep the flat labeled-cell rows.
- Theming toolkit for `@a2ui/lit`-rendered surfaces (see the new
  [Theming](documentation/topics/theming.md) topic):
  - `priv/js/ash_a2ui_theme.css` — a neutral, dependency-free CSS-variable
    theme for the basic catalog (`--a2ui-*` tokens; shadow DOM makes CSS
    custom properties the only styling seam), designed to be imported and
    then overridden with the host app's design tokens.
  - `priv/js/ash_a2ui_catalog.js` — `createAshA2uiCatalog(deps)` builds a
    merged catalog registered under the basic catalog id whose
    ChoicePicker renders a native, token-themed `<select>` for
    `mutuallyExclusive` pickers (checkbox list for `multipleSelection`);
    the basic catalog has no dropdown display style through spec v1.0.
  - `configureAshA2ui` accepts an optional
    `markdown: {ContextProvider, context, render}` entry; the hook mounts
    a Lit context provider on its container so Text headings render as
    real headings instead of literal `## ...` markdown
    (upstream renders raw markdown without an injected renderer —
    google/A2UI#1226).
- Encoder: each table record now renders as a `Card` (`record_row`)
  wrapping `record_row_content` (the `Row` of cells), and every cell is a
  labeled pair — `table_cell_<field>` is a `Row` of a caption `Text`
  (`table_cell_<field>_label`, humanized field name) and the value `Text`
  (`table_cell_<field>_value`) — giving themed surfaces card chrome and
  readable "Label: value" rows with no DSL changes.
- Searchable relationship selects: the `field` entity gains `option_search`
  (a list of public string-typed destination attributes, compile-verified).
  Non-empty `option_search` swaps the static ChoicePicker for a composite —
  a selection-label Text (`/select/<field>/label`), a search TextField
  (`/select/<field>/search`) with a Search button dispatching the new
  `"option_search"` client action (case-insensitive contains OR'd across
  the allowlisted fields, actor/tenant-scoped destination read, clamped to
  `option_limit`, answered with one `updateDataModel` at
  `/options/<field>`), and an option List templated over `/options/<field>`
  whose per-option Buttons dispatch the new `"option_select"` action — the
  server re-fetches the picked record (policies apply), writes the value to
  `/form/<field>` and the canonical label to `/select/<field>`.
  Non-searchable selects are unchanged.
- Nested relationship forms: the new `nested_form` DSL entity inside `:form`
  components, named by the **action argument** a `manage_relationship`
  change consumes (compile-verified on every action the form submits by the
  new `AshA2ui.Verifiers.VerifyNestedForms`). The interaction mode is
  inferred from the change's options via
  `Ash.Changeset.ManagedRelationshipHelpers` — lookups (e.g.
  `type: :append_and_remove`) render as **pick_existing** (a picker adding
  existing records — searchable via `option_search` — and current rows with
  remove buttons), creates (e.g. `type: :direct_control`) as
  **create_inline** (sub-form rows; `fields` defaults to the destination
  create action's accepts minus the relationship's destination attribute).
  `/form/<argument>` is an always-present array of row maps mutated through
  the new server-mediated `"nested_add"`/`"nested_remove"` client actions
  (rows carry server-stamped `"_row"` identity keys); `select_row`
  populates the rows from the record's related records, `submit_form`
  strips underscore keys / reduces pick rows to ids before the argument
  cast, and nested validation errors map to
  `/errors/<argument>/<index>/<field>` plus `"_error_<field>"` in-row
  mirrors. Surfaces using these features carry a new `/select/<name>` state
  path. Deferred: many_to_many join-resource fields, recursive nesting,
  in-picker pagination.
- Row-action prompts: `action` entities gain `prompt_fields` (arguments/
  accepts of the Ash action, compile-verified) and `prompt_title`. Prompt
  actions render as a basic-catalog `Modal` (`row_action_<action>_modal`
  wrapping the trigger button and a content Column of TextFields bound to
  the new reserved `/prompt/values/<action>/<field>` paths). The trigger
  dispatches the new `"prompt"` client action (allowlist + `visible_when`
  enforced; pre-fills `/prompt/values/<action>` from the record and clears
  `/errors`); the Modal's Confirm sends `"invoke"` whose context now may
  carry a `"values"` map — filtered to the declared prompt fields, cast
  against the action's arguments/accepts, and passed as the action params
  (ignored entirely on prompt-less actions). Successful prompt invokes
  clear `/prompt/values/<action>`; validation errors land on
  `/errors/<field>` as usual. `refreshes` on `action` entities is now
  optional (omitted = refresh every table).
- Relationship-path search: `search_fields` entries may be relationship
  paths to public string attributes (`[:referrer, :email]`) — every step but
  the last a public relationship, verified at compile time; matched with the
  same case-insensitive contains through the path (`exists` semantics on
  to-many paths).
- Calculation filters: query `filters` may name expression-backed public
  calculations (equality on the calc value, cast against the calculation's
  type/constraints); module-based calculations are rejected at compile time,
  mirroring the sorting rule.
- Named filter presets: `preset` entities inside `query` declare server-side
  composite predicates the client selects by name only —
  `preset :pending do filter status: :pending, deleted_at: nil end`
  (keyword conditions ANDed; `nil` = `is_nil`, list = membership) or
  `preset :deleted do read_action :deleted end` (the escape hatch for
  predicates the keyword form can't express). `default_preset` applies when
  the client selects none and closes the preset set. `/query` state gains a
  `"preset"` key (only on preset-declaring queries) and the encoder emits a
  `query_preset_picker` ChoicePicker.
- Conditional row-action visibility: `action` entities gain `visible_when`
  (keyword equality/is_nil/membership conditions on public attributes or
  expression calculations, compile-verified castable). The handler enforces
  the conditions on every `invoke`/`prompt` (fetching the record with any
  condition calculations loaded; non-visible actions rejected via
  `/ui/status`). Rendering is best-effort: rows of affected tables gain
  `"_actions"` (visible action names) and `"_visible_<action>"`
  (`[{"id": ...}]`/`[]`) keys, and conditional actions render inside a
  `List` slot templated over the row-relative `_visible_<action>` path —
  the v0.9.1 basic catalog has no visibility property, so renderers without
  nested-template support fall back to `"_actions"`.
- Multi-key calculation sorting verified: `default_sort` and client sorts
  compose expression calculations with attributes
  (`default_sort status_priority: :asc, code: :asc`); no new machinery,
  pinned by test.

- `Ash.Type.Enum` attributes render as ChoicePickers: the TypeMapper now
  detects `Ash.Type.Enum` implementations (previously they fell back to
  TextField because their values live in the module, not in a `one_of`
  constraint), and form inputs and query filter pickers source their options
  from the enum's `values/0`, labeled via `label/1` when declared and
  humanized otherwise.

- Calculation & aggregate columns: table (and display) fields may name
  public calculations and aggregates. They are `Ash.Query.load`ed on every
  read path (initial render, post-action refreshes, `query` reads) and
  serialized through the JSON-safe serializer like attributes. Query
  `sortable`/`default_sort` allowlists accept public aggregates and
  expression-based calculations (anything `Ash.Resource.Info.sortable?/3`
  approves); module-based calculations and any calculation/aggregate in
  `search_fields`/`filters` are rejected at compile time with tailored
  messages, as are calculations/aggregates in form components (not
  writable).
- Multiple named table components: `component :table, :new_items do ... end`
  declares additional, independently configured table sections (own
  `fields`/`read_action`/`row_actions`/`query` each); the unnamed
  `component :table` keeps working (implicit name `:table`). Multi-table
  surfaces scope the data model per table (`/records/<component_name>`,
  `/query/<component_name>`), infix component ids with the table name, and
  render humanized section headings; single-table surfaces are entirely
  unchanged. `invoke`/`select_row` contexts additively carry
  `"component"`; `query` contexts require it on multi-table surfaces. New
  `AshA2ui.Verifiers.VerifyComponents` enforces unique component names,
  table-only naming, and a single `:form`.
- `refreshes` action metadata: `action :approve do refreshes [:new_items] end`
  limits which table components a successful action rewrites (default stays
  refresh-everything); targets and action reachability are compile-time
  verified. `/form`/`/errors`/`/ui/*` follow-up semantics are unchanged.

### Bug Fixes:

- `invoke` on an update-type action in `row_actions` now calls that action
  argument-less on the identified record. Previously it silently routed to
  the form's `update_action` with empty params — a no-op unless the invoked
  action happened to be the form's update action.

- Relationship rendering, part 1 — `belongs_to` form selects: a form field
  whose name matches a `belongs_to` relationship's `source_attribute` renders
  as a `ChoicePicker` automatically (options loaded from the destination's
  primary read action with the surface's `actor:`/`tenant:`/`authorize?:`
  opts). New `field` entity options `relationship` (explicit override),
  `option_label` (default: first existing public attribute of
  `[:name, :title, :label, :username, :email]`, else the destination PK),
  `option_value` (default: destination PK; composite PKs require it
  explicitly), `option_sort` (default: the resolved label, ascending) and
  `option_limit` (default: 100). Options are emitted inline in the picker and
  mirrored at the new reserved `/options/<field>` data-model path;
  single-select string-list submissions are unwrapped before casting.
  Compile-time verification via `AshA2ui.Verifiers.VerifyRelationships`.
- Relationship rendering, part 2 — `source` table columns: the new `source`
  field option (e.g. `source [:user, :email]`) renders a column read through
  the loaded relationship path. Record loading gains the needed
  `Ash.Query.load` statements on every read path; serialization walks the
  path nil-safely (nil/unloaded relationship -> `""`). Source columns are
  table-only and rejected in `ui_query` allowlists at compile time.
- Generic action results are now visible: `AshA2ui.ActionHandler` serializes
  map results to display text at the new reserved `/ui/action_result_text`
  path (one "Humanized key: value" line per key; the raw map stays at
  `/ui/action_result`), the encoder emits an always-present
  `action_result_panel` (Column wrapping a Text bound to it), and both paths
  are cleared on every subsequent successful action.

- Ship [`usage_rules`](https://hexdocs.pm/usage_rules)-compatible LLM usage
  rules: `usage-rules.md` plus `usage-rules/actions.md` and
  `usage-rules/liveview.md` sub-rules, included in the hex package so
  consumers can sync them with `mix usage_rules.sync`.
- `query` DSL entity: named, server-enforced allowlists for search
  (case-insensitive contains OR'd across `search_fields`), sorting
  (`sortable`), equality filters (`filters`), and pagination
  (`page_size`/`max_page_size`, limit/offset with a look-ahead `hasMore`).
  Tables reference a query via the new `query` component option; the encoder
  emits search/filter/pagination controls wired to the new `"query"` client
  action; `AshA2ui.ActionHandler` validates every request against the
  allowlist and rejects anything undeclared via `/ui/status`. The reserved
  `/query` data-model path carries the authoritative query state, and
  `submit_form`/`invoke` success refreshes respect the client's active query.
  Compile-time verification via `AshA2ui.Verifiers.VerifyQueries`.
- PubSub live refreshes preserve the user's query: `AshA2ui.LiveRenderer`
  tracks the last `/query` state pushed to the client and passes it to
  `AshA2ui.Info.build_data_model/2` via the new `:query_state` option
  (validated against the query allowlist; invalid state falls back to the
  declared defaults), so a refresh re-runs the current
  search/filters/sort/page instead of resetting the surface.

### Bug Fixes:

- A `multipleSelection` ChoicePicker reset to its "All" option submits
  `[""]`, which was cast to `field in []` (matching nothing) — empty-string
  list filter values are now treated as inactive, like `""` and `nil`.
