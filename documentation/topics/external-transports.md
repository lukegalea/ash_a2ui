# External Transports (AG-UI and A2A)

AshA2ui's protocol core emits plain A2UI message maps and consumes plain
action envelopes — [Rendering Clients](rendering-clients.md) covers the two
in-app transports (LiveView, plain JSON endpoints). This topic covers making
surfaces consumable by **external agents and non-Phoenix hosts** through the
interoperability stack around A2UI:

* **AG-UI** (agent ↔ user-facing app; CopilotKit's native protocol) —
  **shipped**, via `AshA2ui.AgUi`.
* **A2A** (agent ↔ agent; Google) — **designed, not yet implemented**;
  the binding is documented at the end of this topic.

## The stack, verified

Some precision is warranted, because the ecosystem naming is confusing:

* **A2UI** is the *generative-UI payload spec* — the `createSurface` /
  `updateComponents` / `updateDataModel` messages AshA2ui already emits. It
  is deliberately transport-agnostic.
* **AG-UI** is a *runtime interaction protocol*: ~25 typed JSON event kinds
  (run lifecycle, streamed text, tool calls, state, activities) flowing
  from an agent endpoint to a client, plus a `RunAgentInput` request shape
  flowing back. The default transport encoding is HTTP POST + Server-Sent
  Events. AG-UI is what CopilotKit clients speak natively.
* A2UI payloads ride AG-UI inside **activity events** — there is no
  first-class A2UI event type. The binding (established by
  `@ag-ui/a2ui-middleware`, consumed by CopilotKit's built-in A2UI
  renderer) is an `ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT` event with `activityType:
  "a2ui-surface"` whose `content` carries the A2UI message list under the
  `"a2ui_operations"` key.

An "AG-UI-compatible server" is therefore small and concrete: **one HTTP
endpoint** that accepts a `POST` with a `RunAgentInput` JSON body
(`threadId`, `runId`, `messages`, `state`, `tools`, `context`,
`forwardedProps`) and streams `data: <event-json>\n\n` SSE frames — opening
with `RUN_STARTED` and closing with `RUN_FINISHED` or `RUN_ERROR`.

## What `AshA2ui.AgUi` provides

`AshA2ui.AgUi` is the protocol layer, deliberately framework-free (it
depends only on `Jason`, is always compiled, and works under `NO_PHOENIX`
builds):

| Function | Role |
|---|---|
| `run_started/2`, `run_finished/3`, `run_error/2` | Run lifecycle events |
| `text_message_start/2`, `text_message_content/2`, `text_message_end/1` | Streamed assistant tokens |
| `tool_call_start/3`, `tool_call_args/2`, `tool_call_end/1`, `tool_call_result/3` | Tool activity |
| `surface_activity/2` | An A2UI surface as an `a2ui-surface` activity snapshot |
| `custom/2` | App-specific extension events |
| `encode_sse/1` | One event → one `data: <json>\n\n` frame |
| `decode_run_input/1` | `RunAgentInput` body → thread/run ids, chat messages, `a2uiAction` |
| `decode_action/1` | AG-UI client action → the v0.9.1 envelope `ActionHandler` consumes |

The HTTP endpoint itself stays in the host — that is where authentication,
actor resolution, and process supervision belong (and it keeps the
extension free of a Plug dependency).

## A Phoenix endpoint, end to end

A minimal AG-UI endpoint serving one surface-aware agent turn:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.AgUiController do
  use MyAppWeb, :controller

  alias AshA2ui.AgUi

  # Router: pipe_through your authenticated admin pipeline. The actor comes
  # from the session — NEVER from the request body.
  def run(conn, _params) do
    input = AgUi.decode_run_input(conn.body_params)
    actor = conn.assigns.current_user

    conn =
      conn
      |> put_resp_content_type("text/event-stream")
      |> put_resp_header("cache-control", "no-cache")
      |> send_chunked(200)

    {:ok, conn} = send_event(conn, AgUi.run_started(input.thread_id, input.run_id))

    conn =
      case input.a2ui_action do
        nil -> chat_turn(conn, input, actor)
        action -> surface_action(conn, input, action, actor)
      end

    {:ok, conn} = send_event(conn, AgUi.run_finished(input.thread_id, input.run_id))
    conn
  end

  defp send_event(conn, event), do: chunk(conn, AgUi.encode_sse(event))

  defp chat_turn(conn, input, actor) do
    # Drive your agent loop with input.messages; as it streams, map its
    # events onto AG-UI events (text_message_*, tool_call_*) and chunk them.
    # When the agent decides to show a surface:
    messages =
      AshA2ui.Info.build_surface(MyApp.UI.TicketUI,
        actor: actor,
        spec_version: "0.9.1"
      )

    {:ok, conn} = send_event(conn, AgUi.surface_activity("surface-tickets", messages))
    conn
  end

  defp surface_action(conn, _input, action, actor) do
    {:ok, envelope} = AgUi.decode_action(action)

    follow_ups =
      case AshA2ui.ActionHandler.handle(MyApp.UI.TicketUI, envelope,
             actor: actor,
             spec_version: "0.9.1"
           ) do
        {:ok, messages} -> messages
        {:error, messages} -> messages
      end

    # Re-emit the surface activity with the follow-ups appended; the client
    # replaces the rendered surface in place (same messageId).
    messages =
      AshA2ui.Info.build_surface(MyApp.UI.TicketUI, actor: actor, spec_version: "0.9.1")

    {:ok, conn} =
      send_event(conn, AgUi.surface_activity("surface-tickets", messages ++ follow_ups))

    conn
  end
end
```

Real hosts run the agent loop in a supervised task and receive its events
in the request process (so a crashed LLM call becomes a clean `RUN_ERROR`
frame); see the shape of `AshA2ui.LiveRenderer`'s task handling for the
same pattern in LiveView.

### The event mapping for an agent loop

For a tool-loop agent (e.g. `AshAi.ToolLoop`-style streams), the natural
mapping is:

| Agent loop event | AG-UI event(s) |
|---|---|
| turn starts | `run_started/2` |
| streamed assistant token | `text_message_start/2` (first token) + `text_message_content/2` |
| tool call begins | `text_message_end/1` (close any open message) + `tool_call_start/3` + `tool_call_args/2` + `tool_call_end/1` |
| tool result | `tool_call_result/3` |
| tool renders a surface | `surface_activity/2` with the built A2UI messages |
| turn ends | `text_message_end/1` + `run_finished/3` |
| turn crashes | `run_error/2` |

## The client-action round trip

When a user interacts with a rendered surface, CopilotKit's action bridge
attaches the action to the **next run**: it sets
`forwardedProps.a2uiAction = %{"userAction" => %{...}}`, runs the agent
once, and clears the property. On the server:

1. `decode_run_input/1` exposes the payload as `:a2ui_action`.
2. `decode_action/1` converts it into a spec-valid v0.9.1 client envelope
   (renderer extras dropped, required-but-omitted fields defaulted).
3. Route the envelope through `AshA2ui.ActionHandler.handle/3` (declared
   surfaces) or `AshA2ui.Dynamic.handle_action/3` (agent-composed
   surfaces) **with the session-derived actor** — the row-action
   allowlist, `visible_when` enforcement, query allowlists, and Ash
   policies all apply exactly as on in-app transports.
4. Append the returned `updateDataModel` follow-ups to the surface's
   operations and re-emit `surface_activity/2` under the same
   `messageId` — the client updates in place.

Because HTTP runs are stateless, a host that serves actions must remember
*which* surface a thread is showing (the UI module or the resolved
`AshA2ui.Dynamic.Surface` — the Dynamic host contract requires the
server-held struct). Key that state by **authenticated actor + thread id**,
never by client-supplied thread id alone.

## Wiring a CopilotKit client (no Node middleman)

CopilotKit's production-supported `selfManagedAgents` prop connects the
React client **directly** to your Phoenix endpoint — no CopilotRuntime /
Node.js layer:

```tsx
import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";
import { CopilotKit, CopilotChat, createA2UIMessageRenderer }
  from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import "@copilotkit/react-core/v2/styles.css";

const agent = new HttpAgent({
  url: "/my/ag-ui/endpoint",
  headers: { "x-csrf-token": readCsrfTokenFromMetaTag() },
});

// With a self-managed agent there is no runtime /info discovery, so mount
// the A2UI renderer explicitly:
const renderers = [createA2UIMessageRenderer({ theme: myTheme })];

<CopilotKit
  selfManagedAgents={{ "my-agent": agent }}
  renderActivityMessages={renderers}
>
  <CopilotChat agentId="my-agent" />
</CopilotKit>;
```

Authentication rides your existing web session: `HttpAgent` uses `fetch`,
which sends same-origin cookies by default; add your CSRF token header for
POST endpoints behind `protect_from_forgery`.

## The authentication / actor contract

The same contract as every AshA2ui transport, restated because this one
faces external clients:

1. **The host authenticates the transport.** Router pipelines or plugs
   decide who may reach the endpoint at all.
2. **The actor comes from the session, never the body.** Everything in
   `RunAgentInput` (`threadId`, `state`, `forwardedProps`, messages) is
   client-controlled input.
3. **`authorize?: true` stays on.** AshA2ui never bypasses policies;
   do not pass `authorize?: false` on a network-facing transport.
4. **Per-thread server state is actor-scoped.** A thread id is a client
   claim, not an identity.

## The A2A binding (designed, deferred)

[A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org) is the agent-to-agent protocol; a2ui.org
publishes an official **A2UI extension for A2A** that we verified against
the v0.9.1 and v1.0 extension specifications:

* Activation: the client requests the extension via the transport's
  extension mechanism (the `X-A2A-Extensions` header for JSON-RPC/HTTP);
  agents advertise it (and their `supportedCatalogIds`) in their Agent
  Card `capabilities.extensions`.
* Server → client: A2UI messages are encoded as an A2A `DataPart` with
  `metadata.mimeType: "application/a2ui+json"`; the part's `data` field
  **must be an array** of A2UI messages validating against the
  server-to-client message-list schema.
* Client → server: the same `DataPart` shape, with `data` carrying
  `action` messages validating against the client-to-server list schema —
  i.e. exactly the envelopes `AshA2ui.ActionHandler.handle/3` consumes.
* Metadata: `a2uiClientCapabilities` (supported catalogs) travels in every
  client message's `metadata`; when `sendDataModel` is enabled the client
  echoes `a2uiClientDataModel` the same way. A2UI sessions map to A2A
  `contextId`.

Since AshA2ui's message lists are already spec-valid maps, the eventual
implementation is thin: wrap `AshA2ui.Info.build_surface/2` output in a
`DataPart` (`%{"kind" => "data", "data" => messages, "metadata" =>
%{"mimeType" => "application/a2ui+json"}}`) inside an A2A task/message
envelope, and unwrap incoming parts into `ActionHandler`. What it waits on:

* an A2A server to embed in (there is no mature Elixir A2A server library
  as of July 2026 — the JSON-RPC task lifecycle, Agent Card serving, and
  push notifications are the actual work, none of it A2UI-specific);
* a concrete consumer (the AG-UI path already covers user-facing chat
  clients; A2A pays off for agent-to-agent surface handoff).

When that lands it should follow this topic's shape: a framework-free
binding module (`AshA2ui.A2a`) plus host-side documentation, with the
DataPart payloads conformance-tested against the vendored A2UI schemas.
