defmodule AshA2ui.Canvas.Registry do
  @moduledoc """
  The host-configured catalogue of what the canvas knows to exist.

  A registry is a module implementing this behaviour. `domains/0` returns
  the compile-known Ash domain modules the canvas may traverse — this is the
  entire discovery surface (`CANVAS-SEC-005`): what the registry does not
  list does not exist, and no resolver path ever widens it. The optional
  `label/1` callback lets a host override display labels; it receives
  `:application`, a domain module, a resource module, or a record struct,
  and returning `nil` (or not implementing the callback) falls back to the
  library's humanized defaults.

  The library ships `Canvas.Test.Registry` over the test-support fixtures;
  hosts implement their own.
  """

  @doc """
  The domain modules the canvas may traverse. Compile-known modules only —
  the resolver matches client refs against these as strings and never
  converts input into module names.

  @doc """
  Optional projection override. Receives a resource module or a record
  struct together with the projections the library derived from the
  resource's own actions, and returns the list the object should carry;
  `nil` (or not implementing the callback) keeps the derived list.

  This exists because some projections cannot be derived from action shape
  at all. `:diagram` and `:history` are in the vocabulary precisely for
  things like a process definition and a running instance, and no amount of
  reading a resource's actions reveals that one of them is drawable — only
  the host knows it ships a renderer for it.

  The returned list is filtered against the declared vocabulary, so a host
  cannot introduce a projection kind the experience compiler has no meaning
  for. Returning `[]` is allowed and means "no projections", which is not
  the same as returning `nil`.
