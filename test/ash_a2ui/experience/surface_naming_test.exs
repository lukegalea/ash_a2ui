  @moduledoc """
  A surface's heading is what the page is a page *of*, and the derived name
  cannot always supply it.

  Before `title`, every heading was the humanized module short name. That is
  singular where the page is a list, and it is named after a module rather than
  after the thing: a strangler read model over another application's estate is
  `Legacy.User`, so its page was headed "User" — which reads as *this*
  application's users, and is the one reading that is definitely wrong.

  `title` and `record_label` are separate on purpose. They are different words
  in the same surface: the heading is a collection ("Legacy users"), and the
  task labels take a singular ("Create legacy user"). Collapsing them into one
  option would force one of the two to be ungrammatical.
