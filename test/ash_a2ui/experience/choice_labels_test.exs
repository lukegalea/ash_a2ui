defmodule AshA2ui.Experience.ChoiceLabelsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A field's choices read the same way everywhere on the surface.

  `choice_options/2` has always labelled enum values for form pickers, so a
  select showed "Direct user and team". The grid beside it showed
  `direct_user_and_team`, because a record's value reached the wire as its bare
  atom name. One field, one surface, two vocabularies — and the raw one is the
  one a reader has to decode.

  The interesting case is not the happy path (the golden payloads in
  `encoder_test.exs` and `multi_table_test.exs` pin that). It is the values the
  field does *not* declare: those must pass through untouched rather than be
  rewritten by a guess, because a surface can carry strings that merely look
  like choices.
